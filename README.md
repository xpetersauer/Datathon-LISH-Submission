# Datathon LISH Submission
This repository is my unedited submission for the Datathon for the Laboratory of Innovation Science at Harvard University. I received third place and $250 for implementing this random forest algorithm

# Important Note and Context
Please keep in mind that this submission is unedited, meaning that, as a result of implementing this algorithm in approximately a day, the code is a little more messy than my typical project. 

# Explanation File
The creators of the Datathon@LISH requested an explanation for my thought processes and a general overview of my implementation. I have included this file in this repository, but you can also [view the blogpost from their website](https://www.datathonatlish.com/announcements)
